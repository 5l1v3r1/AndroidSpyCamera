# AndroidSpyCamera

This app shows how you can quietly take photos of app user via front camera. After opening it shows an image with puzzle (its role is to attract attention) while fromt camera takes photos every 2 secs and saves it into ~/Android/data/{appId}/files.

Basically advantage: app targets on API 22, so you WILL NOT SEE A RUNTIME PERMISSION TO ACCESS CAMERA.

If you want to protect your privacy:
 - trust no one
 - close your front camera

If you want to break someone's privacy:
 - add this code to your app
 - use encryption to hide fact of capturing
 - send all encrypted photos next time user turn on the Internet

I DO NOT PROPAGANDIZE THIS.
I just want you to know how it is easy to break your privacy!

This app is based on Camera2Basic repo from Google.
