# AndroidSpyCamera

This app shows how you can quietly take photos of app user via front camera. After opening it shows an image with puzzle (its role is to attract attention) while fromt camera takes photos every 2 secs and saves it into ~/Android/data/<app-id>/files.


I DO NOT PROPAGANDIZE THIS.
I just want you to know how it is easy to break your privacy!


This app is based on Camera2Basic repo from Google.
